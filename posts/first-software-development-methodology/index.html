<p>Luckily, somebody significantly more determined than myself already did the hard work. Dr. David F. Rico has identified a timeline of software development methodologies, at least in broad strokes.</p>

<p>My favorite part of this paper is how he broke down each methodology into the Era and identified Market Conditions that surrounded each methodology. While reading the list I laughed at the fact that the first two methodologies, Flowcharting and Structured Design, were aimed at fighting unreadable and complex programs.</p>

<p>Good thing we got that out the way early on&hellip;</p>
