<p><strong>Complexity</strong></p>

<p>Most programs are too complicated - that is, more complex than they need to be to solve their problems efficiently. Why? Mostly it&#39;s because of bad design, but I will skip that issue here because it&#39;s a big one. But programs are often complicated at the microscopic level, and that is something I can address here.</p>

<p><strong>Rule 1.</strong> You can&#39;t tell where a program is going to spend its time. Bottlenecks occur in surprising places, so don&#39;t try to second guess and put in a speed hack until you&#39;ve proven that&#39;s where the bottleneck is.</p>

<p><strong>Rule 2.</strong> Measure. Don&#39;t tune for speed until you&#39;ve measured, and even then don&#39;t unless one part of the code overwhelms the rest.</p>

<p><strong>Rule 3.</strong> Fancy algorithms are slow when n is small, and n is usually small. Fancy algorithms have big constants. Until you know that n is frequently going to be big, don&#39;t get fancy. (Even if n does get big, use Rule 2 first.) For example, binary trees are always faster than splay trees for workaday problems.</p>

<p><strong>Rule 4.</strong> Fancy algorithms are buggier than simple ones, and they&#39;re much harder to implement. Use simple algorithms as well as simple data structures.</p>

<p>The following data structures are a complete list for almost all practical programs:</p>

<p>array</p>

<p>linked list</p>

<p>hash table</p>

<p>binary tree</p>

<p>Of course, you must also be prepared to collect these into compound data structures. For instance, a symbol table might be implemented as a hash table containing linked lists of arrays of characters.</p>

<p><strong>Rule 5.</strong> Data dominates. If you&#39;ve chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self­evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming. (See The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering by F. P. Brooks p. 102.)</p>

<p><strong>Rule 6.</strong> There is no Rule 6.</p>
