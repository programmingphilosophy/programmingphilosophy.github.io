<p>&hellip; An empirical, systems-based approach addresses the chaos in distributed systems at scale and builds confidence in the ability of those systems to withstand realistic conditions.  We learn about the behavior of a distributed system by observing it during a controlled experiment.  We call this Chaos Engineering.</p>

<p>Those people over at Netflix do know a thing or two about scaling. As someone who is building a complex (and sometimes complicated), distributed system, these simple yet challenging principles seem very helpful. I will be trying them out to see how they change the work we are doing at Octoblu.</p>

<p>Netflix has <a href="http://techblog.netflix.com/2014/09/introducing-chaos-engineering.html">blogged about Chaos Engineering in the past</a>, and <a href="http://techblog.netflix.com/2015/09/chaos-engineering-upgraded.html">recently updated on their progress</a>.</p>
