<p>DHH has <a href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/tdd-is-dead-long-live-testing.html">consigned TDD to the scrapheap of history</a>. I&#39;m sad, not because I rescued it from the scrapheap of history in the first place, but because now I need to hire new techniques to help me solve many of my problems during programming:</p>

<ul>
<li>Over-engineering. I have a tendency to &#34;throw in&#34; functionality I &#34;know&#34; I&#39;m &#34;going to need&#34;. Making one red test green (along with the list of future tests) helps me implement just enough. I need to find a new way to stay focused.</li>
<li>API feedback. I need to find a new way to get quick feedback about my API decisions.</li>
<li>Logic errors. I need to find a new way to catch those pesky sense-of-test errors I&#39;m so prone to making.</li>
<li>Documentation. I need to find a new way to communicate how I expect APIs to be used and to record what I was thinking during development.</li>
<li>Feeling overwhelmed. I&#39;m really going to miss how, using TDD, even if I couldn&#39;t imagine an implementation I could almost always figure out how to write a test. I need to find a new way to take that next step up the mountain.</li>
<li>Separate interface from implementation thinking. I have a tendency to pollute API design decisions with implementation speculation. I need to find a new way to separate the two levels of thinking while still providing rapid feedback between them.</li>
<li>Agreement. I need to find a new way to be precise with a programming partner about what problem I&#39;m solving.</li>
<li>Anxiety. Perhaps what I&#39;ll miss most is the way TDD gives me an instantaneous &#34;Is Everything Okay?&#34; button.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll find other ways to solve all these problems. In time. The pain will fade. Farewell TDD, old friend.</p>
